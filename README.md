# etchasketch

A simple etch-a-sketch page rendered from JavaScript.

To play, simply load the page in your browser and follow the instructions :)

The game has three modes:

1. Normal - squares flip between white and black tiles as the mouse moves across
2. Randomizer - on mouseover, each tile changes to a random color
3. Darken - on mouseover, each tile gradually fades to black

The 'reset' button starts the board in normal mode
